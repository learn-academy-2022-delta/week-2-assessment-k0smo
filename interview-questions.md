# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: parameter are in parantheses or arrow function signatures parameters are the arguments value seprerated by commas - Arguments- are data value you pass into the methods parameters.. arguments is an array and the value . 

  Researched answer: Arguments is the value of the parameters and parameters are the data.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map()method to iterate over an array of parameters and is used to call back functions. map() is always called with the current element the index of the element and the whole array.

  Researched answer: The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:They both return a new array. map returns a new array of elements where you have applied some function on the element so that it changes the original element (typically). filter returns a new array of the elements of the original array (with no change to the original values). filter will only return elements where the function you specify returns a value of true for each element passed to the function.

  Researched answer:map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array individually. filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong.So map returns the same number of elements as the original, but the element value will be transformed in some way and filter will return the same or less number of elements than the original but not change the original elementsâ€™ values.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A method is like a function, except it is associated with an object. and a function is associated with an object. map() is used to make code more short and concise. as a replacement for lengthy loops.

  Researched answer: function execute instructions of data to variables and return result and can be used to code again.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: destructuring is be used to extract data from arrays or objects and maps. It is used to make it possible to take out variables from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. 

  Researched answer: Destructuring is a javascript expression that can be used to extract data from into distinct variables. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: hoisting is a javascript expression that can be used to move the declaration of a variable,function or classes to the top. allowing code to be safely used in code befroe they are declared. hoistig allows you to use functions and variables before the are declared. 

  Researched answer:  Hoisting is the process where the interpreter moves the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, before  execution of the code. Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: this creates a method that inherits all the methods from another class.

2. React: React allows the programmer to define components as classes or functions. render()

3. React state: is for property storage for components.

4. React lifecycle methods: Mounting, updating by changes to props or state, unmounting
constructor() render()componentDidMount()

5. DOM: A DOM structure defines the way a document is accessed and is a programming api that has a structure tree with nodes that is an object representing a part of the document. DOM is the programming interface for web documents.
